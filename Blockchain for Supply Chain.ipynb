    "#### 1 Difficult for Small Businesses\n",
    "- Manufacturers prefer large companies as customers, squeezing out everyday innovators.\n",
    "- Mom-and-pop manufacturers are forced to spend time providing quotes without pay\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 Opaque Procurement Process\n",
    "- Current manufacturing lacks accessibility to the procurement process. \n",
    "- 31% of buyers cite finding the right manufacturing suppliers is a standard issue in the production process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 Outdated Technology\n",
    "- Current tech and manufacturing processes are outdated. \n",
    "- Inefficient product procurement processes account for a yearly loss of 1.5 billion USD in revenue for North American businesses.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A supply chain blockchain could boost transparency, trust, and predictability by allowing users to track where a shipment is at any given time. \n",
    "- Since a blockchain is an immutable ledger, changes in possession and ownership of goods as they move from their producer to their point of retail could be entered into the ledger instantaneously and permanently. \n",
    "- Because a blockchain is decentralized, it has no single point of failure. \n",

    "- So, shipping, possession and ownership information could be better protected from tampering or hacks.\n",
    "- Supply chain professionals can use blockchain technology to gather and use tracking data in dynamic new ways. \n",
    "- Entries in a blockchain database could trigger other tasks such as the assignment of the next batch of goods arriving at a port to a certain dock or container area.\n",
    "-  Applying blockchain technology to instant settlement of transactions could also reduce friction in commercial financing\n",

    "- Dispute resolution rules could be agreed upon beforehand and applied instantly on the blockchain when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blockchain can help companies realize the digital supply chain by providing a “single version of the truth” for the entire supply chain. \n",
    "- By sharing important information such as sales data, inventory levels, order and shipment information, companies can eliminate information delays and the uncertainty that contributes to “the bullwhip effect,” and inflates safety stock.\n",
    "- This common consensus companies achieve the often pursued but rarely attained, supply chain visibility. \n",
    "- With all partners posting to a common ledger, businesses can gain visibility to their entire networks, from their suppliers’ suppliers to their customers’ customers. \n",
    "- This enables them to foresee problems and address them, resulting in a smoother, more efficient supply chain.\n",

    "##### “In theory, blockchain can at last integrate – and hence synchronize – the flows of goods, information and money. In the coffee supply chain, blockchain can ensure that all the relevant chain partners – including the farmer at the start of the chain – can be paid within minutes of a consumer purchasing a jar of coffee in their local supermarket. This would significantly reduce the bullwhip effect while also eliminating cash-flow problems in the chain.” Martijn Lovfers\n",
